  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `style`: CSS or styling changes
  - `update`: A non-breaking change
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `delete`: Removing code or files

### Documentation

- Use inline comments to clarify complex parts of your code.
- Remove all commented-out code before committing.
- Ensure all functions and files have clear, concise descriptions.

### Project Management

- Keep the project's scrum board (e.g., Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects) up-to-date.
- Write specific and descriptive cards for all tasks.
- PR descriptions should be detailed, outlining the changes made and referencing the corresponding task on the scrum board.
